# Caos

This project uses and the Caos's framework, placed at `lib/caos`. More information on it can be found online:

 - Caos' GitHub page: https://github.com/arcalab/CAOS
 - Caos' tutorial: https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14901
 - Caos' demo video: https://youtu.be/Xcfn3zqpubw 

The project can also be included as a submodule, as explained in the documentation of Caos.

## Requirements

- JVM (>=1.8)
- sbt

## Compilation

You need to get the submodules dependencies (CAOS library), and later compile using ScalaJS, following the steps below.
The result will be a JavaScript file that is already being imported by an existing HTML file. 

1. `git submodule update --init`
2. `sbt fastLinkJS`
3. open the file `lib/tool/index.html`
